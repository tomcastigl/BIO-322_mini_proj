BIO322 mini project A, Thomas Castiglione.

The notebook can be found in "src/ProjectA.ipynb", the submission csv files in the "submissions" directory, and the data sets are stored in the "data" directory. The report can be found directly in this directory.

The best submission I made on kaggle is the file "BEST_submisson_nn_60-80-d01-40-10-10-10-1_new_try.csv". And the best one with linear method is "submission_lasso.csv". Other .csv files are some intermediate submissions and should not be taken in account.
